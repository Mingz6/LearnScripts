# .NET CLI Commands

This document provides a list of commonly used .NET CLI commands for managing .NET projects.

## Commands

### Restore Dependencies
Restores the dependencies and tools of a project.
```sh
dotnet restore
```

Build Project
Builds the project and its dependencies.
```sh
dotnet build
```

Clean Project
Cleans the output of the previous build.
```sh
dotnet clean
```

Rebuild Project
Cleans and then builds the project.
--no-incremental: Forces a full rebuild, ignoring any cached build outputs.
-v minimal: Sets the output verbosity to "minimal" â€” you'll only see essential info (warnings, errors, and a final summary).
```sh
dotnet build --no-incremental -v minimal
```

Combined Clean and Build
Cleans and then builds the project in one command.

```sh
dotnet clean; dotnet build | grep -i "error";
```

### Run Project

cd dotnet/<Domain>/<System>.<Domain>.<AppName> && func start;

func host start --port <7110> --verbose
```
