# Per-repo dev environment declaration (read by ~/.zshrc hook)
# This file is intended to be local-only; keep it out of git.
#
# Lines are optional; omit a line to keep that tool disabled for this repo.
#
# Manual activation (one-off, if you chose to omit lines below):
#
# Conda:
#   conda activate Dev20260101
#   # (optional) conda deactivate
#
# Nvm (since nvm is lazy-loaded by ~/.zshrc):
#   . "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"
#   nvm use 22.17.1      # or: nvm use default
#
# Tip: after editing `.env.local`, you can `cd .. && cd -` to re-apply.
#
# conda-env="Dev20260101"
# nvm-env="22.17.1"    # or "default"
